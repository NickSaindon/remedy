                Remedy is an export business that specializes in the shipment of Thai Kratom to vendors in the US. It is owned and operated
                by two American brothers.  One that lives in Thailand and one that lives in the United States. After much research this 
                opportunity presented itself in the Kratom trees that grow in humid and tropical locations like the forest across Southeast 
                Asia. Currently the only two countries that export Kratom are Indonesia and Thailand.  However, Thailand has now opened its market for
                Kratom domestically and internationally, where much talk from the Indonesian government has occured about closing off the export of its Kratom.
                <br/><br/>  
                Our goal is to ship quality Kratom that is safe from any metals, bacteria, and that is grown naturally without the useage of any pesticides.  
                Remedy only looks to ship to vendors that are members of the AKA (American Kratom Association).  This is to maintain a realationsip 
                that is based on trust in the quality of the product we ship.  Furthermore, we work with the vendors that are members of 
                the AKA because they have committed to the AKA Good Manufacturing Practices program and we are commited to producing a higher quality product 
                that is superior to others.
                <br/><br/> 
                Another goal of Remedy is to help meet the needs of all the vendors we work with.  We do this by doing the pain stacking research of all the different 
                processing methods and how we can get the full alkaloids and componds from the Kratom leaf.  We can process the Kratom in a varity of ways such as 
                fine powder, nano powder, extracts, brews, and teas.    
                <br/><br/>
                Remedy is located in the district of Bang Kapong which is in the providence of Chachoengsao.  Chachoengsao is where our facory is located 
                and where we process the Kratom.  Right now we can ground the Kratom either as fine powder or nano powder.  Remedy may offer resin or teabags in the future.

              <h2 className="text-center">Plantation Investment</h2>
